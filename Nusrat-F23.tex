I am a PhD student in Computer Science at UCCS with Dr. Adham Atyabi and my research is on Brain Computer Interface (BCI), particularly human-in-the-loop BCI. This is my first semester working on this area and to start with

I need to update myself with advancements in the field, beginning from the history of BCI up until the latest and/ or state of the art methods in BCI. A good way to do so would be to write a review paper on the topic, and here is where I am hoping CS 6000 will serve a dual purpose. Aside from what the course has to offer, I plan to take this opportunity to find and study previously published papers in the area. At the end of the course I hope to have written a review paper on my research area, which I can have published with some evaluation from my mentors. I hope the effect of taking this course will last the lifetime of my academic and professional career. In my personal life, I like to cook, practice being healthful, and learn languages. I used to read fictions a lot when I was younger and I am trying to get back to that again.

I have been trying to learn about EEG data through and through and how to use Python and MATLAB packages to process and analyze them. Just recently, I used this repository \url{https://github.com/berdakh/mne-codes/blob/main/BCIcompetitionIV2MNE.ipynb} to play around with some EEG data and it was very helpful. The code utilizes MNE which is a python package made for analyzing and visualizing different types of neurophysical data. It is a good alternative for EEGLAB which is MATLAB package for similar purposes.

\section{Questions}

I understand you just started research on BCI. How are you finding it? Does it excite you? Zainab Olalekan
