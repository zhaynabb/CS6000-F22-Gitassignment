Hello, my name is Hassan shakil I am a first year Ph.D. student in UCCS. My major is Computer Science. The reason why I am taking this course in my first semester of the Ph.D. program is that after successfully completing this course I will have knowledge about computer science research and it will help in my Ph.D. degree and also I will get exposure to cutting-edge research in the field which will enable me to explore my passion and abilities. My Research interest in Text summarization using Natural Language Processing. Some personal things about me are that I was an E-sports player in my college team, I love to play and watch soccer.
